Huesofblue is a developing platform intended to provide support to anyone at anytime and anywhere. The current project was created over the course of five days by four developers who have been coding for a month and have not worked on a group project before. 

Features:

-Registeration as two types of users (mentors and mentees)
-A map containing a list of mentors in your zipcode
--in order for the map to appear, replace 'REPLACE' on the dashboard.html page with your own google api key
-The ability to filter through mentors who are willing to help with a particular concern
-The ability to connect with mentors in your given area. Once connected, the mentee receives the mentors contact information.

Validations needed:
-Breaks when no options are checked of during filtering

Future Features:
-Admin user to approve mentors
-Limiting number of mentees a mentor can have
-More information on mentors on site
-A forum for each concern
